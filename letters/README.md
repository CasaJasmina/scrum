# Letters from and for residents of CasaJasmina

The open source connected home of the future, @casajamina in Torino, Italy (http://casajasmina.arduino.cc/) is a living, live-in lab. A place where temporary residents explore the notion of an open source connected home.

Casa Jasmina was founded by Jasmina Tesanovic and Bruce Sterling together with the Office of Arduino. 

As the space evolves, so do insights, needs and relations between the temporary residents and the space, as well as among each other.

# What is this respository

There are many ways to contribute to Casa Jasmina, whether you are staying there as a guest, are a resident maker and thinker of Torino, or a compelled individual from anywhere on the globe. 

Receiving a letter from the guests before you, and passing on your observations and notes to the next ones, creates a personal connection, provides a framework of support, and serves to document the progess and conversation around Casa Jasmina.

This respository was created by Michelle Thorne with support by Peter Bihr and Alexandra Deschamps-Sonsino during their stay in Casa Jasmina on July 20, 2015.

# Why Github

Github is one of the essential tools of online collaboration today. Many open source projects share and improve their code using the platform. Organizations who work in the open [use it](http://book.webmaker.org/) to manage projects and invite people to participate with them. 

Also, because Github has a lively and technically savvy community, there are lots of nifty tools available to expand the platform even further. 


# How to use this repository

Explore the letters prior residents left for you. And once you're leaving, leave a letter to the next residents. There are no formal restrictions: Think of it as a guestbook, but without the need to profusely flatter the hosts. This is to share insights, needs, criticism, pointers, questions - or to pose challenges.

Like with Casa Jasmina as a whole, make these letters your own. Use them as you see fit.

For practical purposes, we recommend just putting a text (or markdown) file in this folder, named starting with the date (YYYYMMDD) to make it easy to navigate and dig through the archives in chronological order.
